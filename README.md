Game is under development and is currently not fully playable.

## Summary
You’re a tree, but not just any tree, you have the power to move like a rocket! You’re lost in a world filled with chaos, moving objects and other traps and your mission is to return home with all your other fellow trees. Be careful - don't collide with any any objects and avoid any traps on the way back home.

## Controls:
Press space to move forward, and the left and right arrows to rotate (A and W will also work).
